					<h1>What I Do — Research, But With Plot Twists</h1>
					<p class="major">Welcome to the next page! Here, I’ll share more about my professional interests.
						My work generally begins with a problem I think matters, followed by the realization that the necessary data does not exist, and if it does, it’s guarded like a state secret. 
						I then spend months stitching together fragments of information, occasionally surrendering and pivoting to a new question with the blind hope that maybe the data gods will be kinder. 
						This page is a record of those journeys: mostly failures, some small victories, and a lot of stubborn optimism.</p>

						<br> <em> Photo: Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore.<br>
							I visited the Flower Dome last summer and was shocked by how chilly it was inside, especially when it was blazing hot outside. 
							I thought it was just reckless air conditioning, but turns out the whole place is a sustainability flex. 
							From special heat-reducing glass to cooling only the lower zones and even using waste heat to run their dehumidifiers, the tech behind it is actually super cool.</em>
