                    <p>
                      I study the environmental impacts of semiconductor fabrication and
                      integrated circuit manufacturing, using process-level and industry-scale
                      life cycle assessment (LCA) frameworks to quantify Scope&nbsp;1/2/3

                      I model datacenter server lifecycles — including replacement, refurbishment,
                      and end-of-life pathways — to understand carbon and cost trade-offs in

                      Much of my work focuses on data gaps and uncertainty: building models that
                      make those uncertainties explicit, using sensitivity analysis and
                      computational methods to guide where better data would most improve
                      decisions.

                <h4>Carbon footprinting of semiconductor manufacturing</h4>
                <p>
                  As a PhD researcher in the Olivetti Group at MIT, I analyze semiconductor
                  fabrication and IC manufacturing to quantify Scope&nbsp;1/2/3 emissions.
                  This work combines bottom-up process models with top-down industry data to
                  build LCA frameworks that capture uncertainty and highlight key drivers of
                  impact.

                <h4>Server replacement dynamics in datacenters</h4>
                <p>
                  I model how datacenters should replace or refurbish servers over time,
                  incorporating efficiency trends, operational lifetimes, refurbishment
                  pathways, and system-dynamics representations of fleet evolution. The goal
                  is to understand how refresh strategies interact with embodied emissions,
                  grid carbon intensity, workloads, and cost.

                  This work develops uncertainty-aware carbon footprint models for server
                  hardware and semiconductor-intensive systems. By quantifying data gaps and
                  performing sensitivity analysis, we identify which parameters and supply-chain
                  assumptions matter most for sustainable computing decisions.

                <h4>Fab sustainability assessment at Seagate Technology</h4>
                <p>
                  During a sustainability-focused internship at Seagate’s HDD manufacturing
                  operations in Minnesota, I conducted on-site fab audits and interviews with
                  engineering, EHS, and sustainability teams. I mapped energy, chemical, and
                  material flows and evaluated strategies (including PFAS reduction) to support
                  the fab’s long-term sustainability roadmap.

                  I have also worked on industrial waste-analysis projects, including
                  developing strategies to reduce landfill-to-waste percentages in
                  manufacturing environments and supporting process-improvement efforts through
                  data-driven analysis and Six Sigma–aligned methodologies.
