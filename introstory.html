				<div class="content">
					<p>I was born to South Indian parents from Bangalore, and for the first few years of my life, we moved around the world thanks to my father’s job. 
						Both my parents were software engineers, but after I was born, my mother chose to step back from her career so she could pour all her time and energy into raising me and my sister. 
						Looking back, everything I am today rests on the two pillars they formed — my mother and father — each shaping a different part of me.</p>
					<h3>Growing Up With Arts, Language, and Culture</h3>
					<p> Outside school, my childhood was filled with Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam. I even trained in Yakshagana. 
						Alongside that came my formal training in Sanskrit and Hindi — mostly Sanskrit, which would become a defining thread in my life. 
						My mother, noticing that Sanskrit in school was becoming overwhelming for me as a third language, went searching across the city for help. 
						That search led us — unknowingly — to a turning point: GGSS (Geetha Govinda Samskrutha Sangha, Vijayanagar).</p>
					<p> I walked in as a struggling ten-year-old. I walked out, years later, with a deep grounding in Indian culture and Sanatana dharma, thanks to my gurus, 
						Dr. Venkatasubramanian and Dr. Vishwanathan. What they taught me shaped my worldview, my sense of identity, and my understanding of tolerance. 
						I owe them more than I can say.</p>
					<p> And I owe my mother for even bringing me to that door. Whenever she felt I lacked a skill, she would crisscross the city looking for teachers. 
						She rearranged every household chore around our schedules. She ensured I grew into someone who had a rich life outside academics — hobbies, culture, aspirations, and grounding.</p>

					<h3>A Childhood of Screwdrivers, Soldering, and Engineering</h3>
					<p> While my mother shaped my all-round development, my father shaped my relationship with science and engineering.</p>
					<p> I grew up watching him fix anything and everything. I’ve seen him repair a simple click pen, and I’ve seen him take apart an entire car. 
						One of his weekend hobbies was dismantling our automobiles — the car, scooter, or bike — down to their bones, just to put them back together better than before.</p>
					<p> I had several official “roles” during these adventures:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Torch person: Hold the torch steadily and don’t blink.</li>
						<li>Tool person: Pass the exact wrench or screwdriver he needed.</li>
						<li>Lead person: When he soldered electronics, he held the iron; I supplied the lead.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Through these weekends, I watched an engineer, a mechanic, an electrician, and a civil engineer rolled into one person — all outside his actual job description. I learnt by osmosis.</p>
					<p> One of the stories that stays with me is when we renovated our 40-year-old house. It didn’t have pillar-based construction, so the civil engineer wasn’t sure which walls were load-bearing. 
						A wall was demolished; the next day, a crack appeared in the roof. The engineer panicked. My father calmly sat down with a pen and paper, drew the structures, did calculations, 
						and figured out exactly which wall could be safely removed.</p>
					<p> The engineer didn’t believe him. My father simply said he would stand under the roof as they broke it — if it collapsed, it could collapse on him.
						<br> It didn’t. The house is still standing.</p>
					<p> We’ve never had a handyman at home when my father was around. Why would we?</p>
					<p> With all this, it’s no surprise that engineering was all around me growing up. 
						It wasn’t an abstract idea — it lived in our living room, in our parking space, on our weekend schedule. 
						I always knew what I wanted to be: an engineer.</p>

					<h3>The Moment Science Became Personal</h3>
					<p> Even though I grew up around engineering, I first truly understood what my father did for a living when I was around ten. He worked at Applied Materials. 
						I remember visiting his workplace…</p>
